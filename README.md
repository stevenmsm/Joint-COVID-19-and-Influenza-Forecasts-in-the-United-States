# Joint-COVID-19-and-Influenza-Forecasts-in-the-United-States

This repository contains all the code and data needed to replicate the results in manuscript: "Joint COVID-19 and Influenza Epidemics Forecasts in the United States using Internet Search Information". The arxiv version can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02621. In particular, this repo contains all the code to produce 1-4 weeks ahead COVID-19 cases/death forecasts, and 1-2 weeks ahead %ILI forecasts, for both U.S. national and state level. 

"COVID_Case.R" and "COVID_Death.R" produces 1-4 weeks ahead COVID-19 cases and deaths forecasts for both U.S. national and state level. One can obtain the 8 targeted forecasts in each geographical region by simply run the R script from top to bottom. Both R scripts downloaded COVID-19 related data from New York Times and ILI data from CDC directly in the script, by calling (source) "ILI_COVID_data_clean.R". "Both R scripts uses "Population.csv" which is also in the repo, which stores the census information for all U.S. states (obtained from https://www.census.gov). "COVID_Death.R" uses "true-incident Hospitalization.csv", which stores daily new hospital admissions in all U.S. regions, and can be obatined from the official CDC Forcasthub Github Repo (https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/tree/master/data-truth). The external internet search data source, Google search data, can be found in Harvard Dataverse (doi: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PGNBAX). By downloading "US-covid19-api_raw_results-2022-08-14.zip" and un-zip and download this repo, one can run "COVID_Case.R" and "COVID_Death.R" directly, and produce all 8 targets in each geographical region. Note that the Google search data can be obtained from Google Trends website (https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) or using Google API to pool from Google Trends website.

"ILI.R" produces 1-2 weeks ahead %ILI forecasts for both U.S. national and state level. It also calls "ILI_COVID_Data_Clean.R" which downloads ILI data from CDC directly and COVID-19 cases from New York Times directly. It uses flu related Google search data, which can also be found in Harvard Dataverse (doi: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PGNBAX). By downloading "api_raw_results-2022-09-11.zip" and un-zip and download this repo, one can run "ILI.R" directly, and produce all 2 targets in each geographical region.
